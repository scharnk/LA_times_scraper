# LA_times_scraper

Made this guy a couple years ago, wanted to put it somewhere for safe keeping and future reference. Apologies for the messy state this is in! 

Most of the code builds upon itself in each cell, and towards the end you'll see one which prints the outputs from the LA times home page, and the LA times music page. As always with web scrapers, make sure you throttle your page inquiries (in this example I believe this is done with download_delay).
